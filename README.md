# AI_Trip_Planner 🤖✈️

AI_Trip_Planner is a **learning-focused Agentic AI project** that explores how autonomous AI agents can plan trips intelligently using tools, reasoning, and decision-making workflows.

This project is built to understand **Agentic AI concepts** such as task decomposition, tool usage, memory, and multi-step planning rather than to serve as a production-ready travel app.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To learn and experiment with:

* Agentic AI workflows
* Tool-based reasoning
* Autonomous decision-making by AI agents
* Structured planning using modern AI frameworks

The agent takes a user’s travel intent and plans a trip by reasoning step-by-step and invoking different tools when required.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

* Agentic AI
* Tool Calling
* Multi-step reasoning
* Modular tool design
* Prompt-driven decision flow


---

## 🚀 What This Project Teaches

* How agents decide **which tool to use and when**
* How complex tasks can be broken into smaller steps
* How reasoning chains improve AI reliability
* How real-world workflows can be modeled using agents

---

## 📌 Status

🧪 Learning / Experimental Project
🚧 Actively evolving as new Agentic AI concepts are explored

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add memory for user preferences
* Integrate real APIs (maps, weather, hotels)
* Add multi-agent collaboration
* Build a simple UI (Streamlit / React)
